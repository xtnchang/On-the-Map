# On-the-Map
You can log in and pin your current location to a shared map by entering a location string that is reverse geocoded to map coordinates. You can annotate your pin with a personal link or blurb. The shared map pulls the locations of other users stored in a Parse backend.

On the Map is written in Swift 3. You can download it and run it in any version of Xcode and Simulator. To contribute, submit a pull request.
